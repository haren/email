# Web Email Sending Service Server

This directory contains the frontend part of the project.

## Installation and Requirements

The project has been build using [backbone](https://backbonejs.org). It has a few external dependencies that in the current setup had to be installed manually. They can all be found in [js/libs](https://github.com/haren/email/tree/master/www/js/libs) directory for javascript, and in [css](https://github.com/haren/email/tree/master/www/css) for css.

The solution is **fully static** so requires no build / bundling managers.

## Testing

The application has been tested on Chrome v. 46.0, Firefox v. 42.0, and Chrome Mobile v. 47.0 on iOS.
